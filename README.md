# TalkGPT
This is a C# example that combines ChatGPT with Microsoft Cognitive Services, allowing for voice conversations with ChatGPT. It has the potential to evolve into interesting applications such as elderly care and other engaging functionalities.

As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to apply for API keys. However, if you're interested in obtaining API keys for OpenAI and Microsoft services, you can visit their respective websites and follow their instructions for obtaining the necessary credentials.

這是一個結合 chatgpt 以及 微軟認知服務的c# 範例，可以直接與chatgpt做語音上的對話。可以進化為老人照護以及其他更有趣的功能。
